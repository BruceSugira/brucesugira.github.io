            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Bruce Sugira, a recent high school graduate with a passion for languages, literature, and cultural studies. During my time in school, I majored in English, French, Literature, and Kinyarwanda, complemented by courses in history, philosophy, and Latin.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a diverse range of interests that include consuming entertainment such as videos, songs, and comedy, as well as engaging in sports like football, volleyball, swimming, and basketball. I also enjoy exploring new stories through good books and movies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In high school, I successfully managed the school newspaper and library, showcasing my skills in organization, leadership, and communication. I am well-spoken and knowledgeable about pop culture and technology trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I am passionate about entrepreneurship and always look for ways to combine my interests with making money and helping others.
